Fixed:
- Inability to refresh the gallery when re-opening the app after it has been moved to the background
by pressing the "Back" navigation button. The data is now updated automatically in this case
- Incorrect orientation of some downloaded JPEGs

Changed:
- Made downloads initiated from the viewer run in background.
Click the "Download" button and continue swiping, no more need to wait for completion
